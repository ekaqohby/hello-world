My First Repository 
My name is Aaron Cho, who major in philosophy at Korea University. 
I love learning, love almost everything that lies around the world. 
My goal with computer language and programming is to get to the point where I can comfortably convert my ideas into reality (maybe, virtual, practical) with technological way.
